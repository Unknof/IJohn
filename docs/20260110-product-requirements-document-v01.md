**1. Executive Summary**

Many Harvard Kennedy School students enter their program without early clarity on career direction, relevant industries, or how to engage productively with career support structures. Career guidance therefore starts late and is often insufficiently effective for both students and the Office of Career Advancement (OCA).

This project proposes a lightweight, AI-supported pre-class tool that guides students through structured self-reflection before courses begin. The tool helps students clarify interests, motivations, constraints, and potential career directions at a high level. It may suggest **overall fields, industries, or broad role families**. In later stages, it may be amended to suggest specific courses or members of the alumni network to reach out to. To achieve this, it shall combine the HKS PingPong tool with selected materials and ideas from Grant Freeland’s career orientation class in Fall.

The product will be developed iteratively by a small team, with operational readiness targeted for **mid-May 2026** and June serving as a hard deadline that already assumes schedule risk.

**2. Problem Statement and Objectives**

**Problem**

Incoming students consistently face three issues:

- Lack of early clarity on personal goals post-HKS, career direction, and industry fit

- Fragmented inital guidance across courses, OCA, and informal networks

- Career coaching sessions that start before basic self-reflection has occurred or late in academic year

As a result, early OCA sessions often focus on foundational orientation rather than strategic guidance or goals shift over time making initial sessions less useful.

**Objectives**

By mid-May 2026, the tool should:

- Enable early reflection on interests, motivations, and constraints

- Help students identify **plausible industry or role directions**

- Improve the focus and efficiency of first OCA coaching sessions

- Suggest next steps to and guide through exploratory process

- Create a consistent early-stage career orientation experience

**3. Target Users and Stakeholders**

**Primary Users**

- Incoming MPA(ID), MPP, and MC-MPA students

- Students before or during their first semester

**Secondary Users**

- OCA career coaches

- Faculty involved in leadership and career-related teaching

**Institutional Stakeholders**

- HKS leadership

- Program administration

- Alumni engagement teams

**4. Product Concept and Pedagogical Basis**

The product is a web-based, AI-supported chatbot that students use independently before courses begin. It guides users through a structured reflection process grounded in existing HKS course logic on motivation, interests, and career decision-making, which is *MLD-515M: Serving the Public Good: Planning for Career and Life*.

The tool supports:

- Guided self-reflection

- Hypothesis formation about career direction

- Framing of next steps for human coaching or networking

It explicitly complements, rather than replaces, courses, advisors, and OCA.

**5. MVP Scope and Core Functionality**

**Included in MVP**

- Structured reflection modules with guided prompts

- Free-text student responses stored privately

- Synthesis of responses into a concise personal summary

- **High-level recommendations of industries or broad role directions**

- Output prompts designed for effective OCA coaching conversations

- Clear framing and limitations communicated throughout the experience

**Explicitly Excluded from MVP** (Todo: What is MVP here -> Minimal Viable Project = Not first version)

- Specific job or employer recommendations (Todo: how specific?)

- Direct alumni introductions

- **Course recommendations**

- Evaluation, scoring, or ranking of students (Todo: what do we score?)

- Integration with hiring or applicant tracking systems

Course or networking recommendations may be considered in later iterations once the core reflection workflow is validated.

**6. User Journey and Experience**

Students receive access to the tool before the semester begins. After logging in, they progress through short reflection modules addressing:

- Motivation and values

- Interests and skills

- Constraints and preferences

- Initial career hypotheses

- Potential industry or role directions

At completion, the tool generates a structured personal summary. Students are encouraged to use this summary when engaging with OCA or planning their first semester.

Expected total engagement time is **60 to 90 minutes**, with flexibility to pause and return.

**7. Development Approach and Operating Model**

The product will be built by a **1–3 person team** using a lean, execution-focused approach:

- Narrow and controlled scope

- Weekly tangible deliverables and quick iterations

- Early and repeated stakeholder review

- Minimal technical complexity in the MVP

Progress will be tracked against milestone completion rather than feature volume.

**8. Detailed Roadmap and Milestones (January–May 2026)**

**January 2026: Definition and Alignment**

**Expected completion by mid-January**

- Finalized problem framing and success metrics

- Confirmed MVP scope and exclusions

- Draft reflection question framework

- Governance, ownership, and data principles agreed

- Faculty and OCA alignment checkpoint

- (First simply programmed chatbot based on class material for presentation and testing)

No official development begins before scope and framing are locked.

**February 2026: Prototype and Content Build**

**Expected completion by mid-February**

- End-to-end draft chatbot flow

- Core reflection modules written and reviewed

- Basic functional prototype

- Internal testing with student leadership and OCA

- Consolidated feedback and revision plan

This phase produces a working but unpolished version.

**March 2026: MVP Stabilization**

**Expected completion by mid-March**

- Revised and simplified chatbot flow

- Clear onboarding and instructional language

- Stable MVP suitable for student use (to be tested with 5-20 students)

- Privacy and data handling validated (secondary)

- Decision checkpoint for student pilot

At this stage, the tool should function without facilitation.

**April 2026: Larger Student Pilot and Validation**

**Expected completion by mid-April**

- Pilot with a voluntary student cohort

- Structured feedback via surveys and interviews

- OCA assessment

- Identification of friction points and gaps

- Prioritized backlog for final adjustments

No new conceptual features are added after this point.

**May 2026: Finalization and Rollout Readiness**

**Expected completion by mid-May**

- Final MVP version locked

- User documentation and internal guidance completed

- Communication materials prepared

- OCA briefed on usage and positioning

- Formal confirmation of rollout readiness

Mid-May is the internal go-live readiness point.

**June 2026: Deadline and Buffer**

June is reserved exclusively for:

- Contingency

- Minor fixes

- Institutional scheduling constraints

No core development is planned for June.

**9. Risks and Mitigation**

Key risks include inflated expectations of AI guidance, privacy concerns, and user disengagement.

Mitigation measures include strict scope discipline, explicit positioning, minimal data retention, and continuous feedback loops.

**10. Next Steps and Decision Requests**

To proceed, the following are required:

- Approval of MVP scope and exclusions

- Confirmation of governance and ownership

- Agreement on mid-May readiness target

- Identification of faculty and OCA review partners

Once approved, execution can begin immediately in January.
