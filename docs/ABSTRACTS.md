## 2024 SPG Classbook — MLD 515M (Fall 2024)

### Abstract A (Academic / course-facing)
This workbook supports early-stage career design and reflective planning for students in MLD-515M (Serving the Public Good: Planning for Career and Life). It guides learners through structured exercises to articulate a work view and life view, identify perceived world needs, surface strengths, and assess risk tolerance, culminating in a synthesized statement of guiding values and strengths. The workbook then expands from self-understanding to option-generation via Career Anchors and Odyssey Planning, prompting students to develop and evaluate multiple five-year career narratives and to form a testable “moving-forward” hypothesis. Finally, it operationalizes learning through networking practice, including alumni interviews, goal-setting, and mapping strong-tie networks, translating reflection into concrete exploratory actions.

### Abstract B (Student-friendly / practical)
This is a hands-on worksheet that helps you get clearer on what you want, what you’re good at, and what kinds of careers you should explore. You’ll write out your work and life views, reflect on what the world needs, name your strengths, and think about how much uncertainty you’re comfortable with—then pull that into a short “guiding values and strengths” statement. Next, you’ll use Career Anchors and the Odyssey Planning exercise to sketch three different five-year paths and compare them. The final sections push you to learn by doing: interview alumni, set networking goals, and list specific people in your existing network who can help you test your career hypotheses.

## Product Requirements Document — HKS Career Orientation Pre-Class Tool (v01)

### Abstract A (Executive)
This PRD defines an AI-supported, web-based pre-class reflection tool intended to help incoming Harvard Kennedy School students gain earlier clarity on career direction before engaging with courses or the Office of Career Advancement (OCA). The product addresses late-stage, fragmented career orientation by guiding students through structured modules on motivation, values, interests, skills, constraints, and initial career hypotheses, producing a concise personal summary and high-level recommendations of plausible industries or role families. The MVP is intentionally narrow—excluding job/employer recommendations, alumni introductions, and course recommendations—and is designed to improve the efficiency and focus of early coaching sessions. The roadmap targets operational readiness by mid-May 2026 with iterative development, small-team execution, and risk mitigation focused on expectation-setting, privacy, and engagement.

### Abstract B (Product / implementation-oriented)
The document specifies an MVP chatbot-style web experience that runs a 60–90 minute, self-paced reflection workflow for incoming HKS students, storing free-text responses privately and synthesizing them into structured outputs suitable for OCA conversations. Core features include guided prompt modules, response summarization, and controlled recommendations limited to broad fields, industries, or role directions, with explicit UX language clarifying limitations. The plan emphasizes lean delivery by a 1–3 person team with monthly milestones (definition, prototype/content build, stabilization, pilot, finalization) culminating in mid-May 2026 readiness and June reserved for contingency. Key constraints include strict scope control (no rankings, no ATS integration, no direct alumni intros) and governance decisions around privacy/data handling; success depends on iterative stakeholder review and validated student engagement.
