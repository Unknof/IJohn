Figure out limitations:
- Can you give coworkers access to internal AI?
-   Good question... If necessary, probably doable, but maybe not yet? Can ask Sharad.
- How many and what kind of ressources can we use to build IJohn?
-   A: PingPong and potentially a Google/OneDrive environment. Graphical material from the course book etc.
- How sharp can we define our framework?
-   A: Clarify
- Is there a well defined approach to guide users through Q/A or do we need to build it ourself?
-   A: Build it ourselves I think or what do you mean?
- Is the scope set it stone? Will this always be a HKS internal tool?
-   A: Potentially growing to include the Alumni base - in an extreme case expanded to rest of Harvard, maybe MIT? (Chance for that <5-10%)
