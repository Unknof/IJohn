Figure out limitations:
- Can you give coworkers access to internal AI? -> done
- How many and what kind of ressources can we use to build IJohn? -> Ping Pong
- How sharp can we define our framework?
- Is there a well defined approach to guide users through Q/A or do we need to build it ourself? -> Think form vs open dialog
- Is the scope set it stone? Will this always be a HKS internal tool?
